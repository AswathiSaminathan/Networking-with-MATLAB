Every packet switch holds a finite queue for storing packet the incoming packet and there would only be two events that will be possible either the packet has to wait if the link is busy or drop the packet if the queue is full. In short, this represents the discrete simulation of an event. The following realization of the simulator is made possible using MATLAB.
